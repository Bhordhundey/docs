description: "Create and send your first payout through the Yala API."
---

## Prerequisites

- An active Yala sandbox account. Request access by emailing [support@useyala.com](mailto:support@useyala.com).
- A sandbox API key (`x-api-key`) with payouts permissions.
- A registered business and at least one approved beneficiary in the sandbox dashboard.
- Funded wallets in the Yala app for the currencies you plan to send. Yala does not issue standalone virtual account numbers; wallet balances are managed in-app.

## 1. Configure environments

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="server" title="Choose the right base URL">
    | Environment | Base URL |
    |-------------|----------|
    | Production  | `https://gateway.useyala.com/api/public/` |
    | Sandbox     | `https://gateway.staging.useyala.com/api/public/` |

    Always send HTTPS requests and include the trailing slash to avoid redirect latency.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="key" title="Store your API key securely">
    Save the `x-api-key` in your secret manager and inject it at runtime. Avoid hardcoding keys in source control.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Quote a payout

Call the calculator endpoint to surface total cost, exchange rates, and settlement timing before initiating a payout.

```bash
curl https://gateway.staging.useyala.com/api/public/payouts/calculate/exchange-rate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <SANDBOX_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "sourceAmount": 1000,
    "sourceCurrency": "USD",
    "destinationCurrency": "NGN",
    "feeBearer": "tenant",
    "method": "nip",
    "destinationCountryCode": "NGA"
  }'
```

<Tip>
  Use the `includedFees` array in the response to itemize costs in your UI.
</Tip>

## 3. Initiate the payout

Use the quote data to build a payout request. The `businessId` and beneficiary details must already exist in Yala.

```bash
curl https://gateway.staging.useyala.com/api/public/payouts/initiate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <SANDBOX_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{
    "businessId": "6fd2b69f-c529-4fe4-b680-29256f860553",
    "sourceAmount": 1000,
    "sourceCurrency": "USD",
    "destinationCurrency": "NGN",
    "feeBearer": "TENANT",
    "method": "NIP",
    "destinationCountryCode": "NGA",
    "narration": "Andromeda Galaxy",
    "supportingDocument": "https://sample.com/doc",
    "beneficiary": {
      "countryCode": "NGA",
      "bankCountryCode": "NGA",
      "accountNumber": "8068487823",
      "accountName": "Will Wonker",
      "bankName": "OPay",
      "accountCurrency": "NGN",
      "payoutMethod": "NIP",
      "isIndividual": true
    }
  }'
```

<Tip>
  Persist the `payoutRef` from the response to reconcile downstream status updates.
</Tip>

## 4. Track payout status

- Poll the `status` field in `PayoutData` to drive user-facing updates (e.g., `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `PROCESSING`, `COMPLETED`).
- Record the `meta.statusChange` timeline for audit logs.
- Contact support to enable real-time webhooks for automated status notifications.
