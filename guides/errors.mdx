## Error model

All error responses follow a consistent envelope:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Invalid request payload",
  "data": null,
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "beneficiary.accountNumber",
      "message": "Account number is required"
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  Some legacy endpoints may omit the `errors` array. Always check the `message` field as a fallback.
</Note>

## HTTP status codes

| Code | Meaning | Typical cause | Recommended action |
|------|---------|---------------|--------------------|
| `400` | Validation failure | Missing or malformed fields | Fix the payload and retry. |
| `401` | Unauthorized | Incorrect or missing `x-api-key` | Refresh credentials or regenerate keys. |
| `403` | Forbidden | Tenant not permitted to access the resource | Contact Yala support to adjust permissions. |
| `404` | Not found | Resource removed or incorrect identifier | Confirm the ID and try again. |
| `409` | Conflict | Duplicate payout reference or business constraint | Generate a new idempotency reference. |
| `422` | Unprocessable | Business rule violation (e.g., beneficiary not approved) | Surface the message to internal ops for review. |
| `429` | Rate limited | Too many requests in a short window | Back off exponentially and retry with jitter. |
| `500` | Internal error | Platform issue | Retry with backoff and report to support if persistent. |

## Retry strategy

- Use idempotency keys (e.g., `payoutRef`) when retrying `POST` requests to avoid double submissions.
- Retry `5xx` and `429` responses with exponential backoff (e.g., 1s, 2s, 4s) up to a maximum time window.
- Avoid retrying validation (`4xx`) errors unless the payload is corrected.

## Monitoring and alerting

- Log the `statusCode`, `message`, and any nested `errors` for observability.
- Set alerts on elevated `5xx` or `429` error rates per endpoint.
- Subscribe to [status.useyala.com](https://status.useyala.com) for incident notifications.
