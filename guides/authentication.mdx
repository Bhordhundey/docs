## Overview

All requests to the Yala API must include an API key in the `x-api-key` header. Keys are environment-specific, scoped to your tenant, and grant access to the resources configured for your organization.

<Note>
  Treat your API keys like passwords. Rotate them periodically and delete keys that are no longer in use.
</Note>

## Obtain keys

1. Request sandbox access from [support@useyala.com](mailto:support@useyala.com).
2. Generate API keys in the Yala dashboard. Each key is associated with a specific environment (sandbox or production).
3. Share keys securely with integration partners using a password manager or secret sharing tool.

## Send authenticated requests

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
curl https://gateway.staging.useyala.com/api/public/payouts/calculate/exchange-rate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: <SANDBOX_API_KEY>" \
  -d '{ ... }'
```
```javascript Node.js
import axios from "axios";

const client = axios.create({
  baseURL: "https://gateway.staging.useyala.com/api/public",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "x-api-key": process.env.YALA_API_KEY!
  },
});

const response = await client.post("/payouts/initiate", payload);
```
</CodeGroup>

## Rotate keys

- Maintain at least two active keys per environment so you can swap without downtime.
- Update your application to use the new key, then revoke the old key in the dashboard.
- Audit key usage regularly to ensure dormant keys are disabled.

## Handling leaked keys

If you suspect a key has been exposed:

1. Revoke the compromised key immediately from the dashboard.
2. Generate a new key and update your applications.
3. Contact support with recent request IDs to investigate potential misuse.
