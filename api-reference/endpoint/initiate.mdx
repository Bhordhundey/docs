## Usage notes

- Always provide a valid `businessId` that has sufficient wallet balance in the source currency.
- Attach `supportingDocument` links for payouts that require compliance review.
- The response includes `PayoutData` with lifecycle fields such as `status`, `riskLevel`, and `meta.statusChange`.

<Warning>
  If the payout requires manual approval, it remains in `PENDING_APPROVAL` until an operator approves it via the Yala dashboard.
</Warning>
